Shopping Lists
--------------
-   Create pg class for shoppinglists:
    shopping list could check which users are allowed to access it / delete it /
    add it, etc. Could also then return jsondict wrapped object

-   Investigate -- when we're on a shopping list or item on a single
    screen, perhaps we can click on the list and then not need to make a
    new call to get deets again -- we already have a shopping list
    object? Can we pass the new object through in the page?

    Or have the same view model for multiple pages (ie with
    ShoppingLists show all lists and then a click is
    with:selected_shopping_list something like that?)

    For now doesn't matter too much since calls are cheap and quick
    ...)

Expenses
--------
- Delete works for each expense -- Add confirmation button
  or some such idea so that we don't accidentally delete

- Screen to create categories

- Report Screen for past months / categories

- Monthly email detailing spending in each budget
  and which budgets were good and which were bad
